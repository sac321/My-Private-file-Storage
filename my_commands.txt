This has been solved. I had to update the following file: /etc/apt/sources.list
Following instructions on http://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories
Open the sources.list file and add the following repositories:

deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
deb http://http.kali.org/kali sana main non-free contrib
deb http://security.kali.org/kali-security sana/updates main contrib non-free

Save the file and run the commands below:
apt-get clean
apt-get update
apt-get install wingw-w32 -y
